	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Known as one of the most deadly spooders. They're venom is dangerous enough to kill you in one bite. The crimson hourglass on their butts is nightmare fuel enough. They're black enough to sneak in the shadows and kill you when you least expect it. They're disturbing to look at...in my opinion. If these reasons alone aren't enough to convince you...Rest In Peace mate. :)</p>
